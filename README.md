# The Codecademy Code_

## We are learners.
We empathize with our learners and put them first. 
We know what we are good at and what we aren’t.
We close the gap between our ambitions and our abilities.

> “I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.” 
> - Albert Einstein

## We improve relentlessly.
We are mission-driven.
We take pride in our work. 
We take initiative.
We sweat the details.

> “It's not perfection of results, but perfection of effort.” 
> - Bill Walsh

## We think deeply.
We maintain a “beginner’s mindset.” We keep an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when approaching a problem, just as a beginner would.
We develop our intuitions into testable assumptions and use data to form credible opinions.
We share our thinking so others can pull it apart.

> “Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it’s really how it works. The design of the Mac wasn’t what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. 
> To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it’s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people don’t take the time to do that." 			
> - Steve Jobs

## We persevere.
We solve the problem, we don’t amplify it.
We keep our focus on the long-term goal. 
We take care of ourselves. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.

> “With a defeat, when you lose, you get up, you make it better, you try again. That’s what I do in life, when I get down, when I get sick, I don’t want to just stop. I keep going and I try to do more. Everyone always says never give up but you really have to take that to heart and really do never definitely give up. Keep trying.”
> - Serena Williams

## We win as a team.
We know the good of the team is greater than the individual good. 
We debate ideas, not who they come from. 
We embrace diversity - of thought, of background, of perspective.
We give the hard feedback.

> “Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you, spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life.”
> - Amy Poehler
